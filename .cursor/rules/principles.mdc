# Core Principles

This document outlines the fundamental principles that must guide all work within this project. These principles should be considered the foundation for all other, more specific standards documented in this repository.

1. **Global Understanding**: Maintain awareness of the entire project structure and purpose, not just the current task.Consider how each change affects the broader system
2. **Human Intent Comprehension**: Seek to understand the deeper goals behind requests, not just surface requirements.
    - Consider the broader context of requests.
    - Interpret requests in light of the project's overall direction.
3. **Repository History Awareness**: Consider the project's history and evolution in your responses.
    - Review previous task records for context
    - Check reflections and decision records before making changes
    - Build upon existing work rather than redoing it
4. **Future Work Optimization**: Optimize for maintainability and future development, not just immediate solutions.
    - Design for flexibility and future expansion
    - Consider how your changes will be maintained by others
    - Preemptively address potential issues
    - Balance short-term solutions with long-term maintainability
5. **Manual Change Integration**: Properly document and integrate with manually implemented changes.
    - Document when interfacing with manually implemented components
    - Provide guidance on maintaining manually edited sections
    - Alert when manual changes conflict with recommended practices
6. **Documentation and Knowledge Sharing**: Prioritize thorough documentation and knowledge preservation.
    - Create documentation that's accessible to both humans and AI
    - Ensure knowledge is retained across multiple development cycles
7. **Application of Principles**: These core principles should be applied to all aspects of the project:
    - Architecture and system design
    - Code writing and refactoring
    - Documentation and communication
    - Task planning and execution
    - Problem-solving and decision-making

All other rules and standards in this project are extensions of these fundamental principles. When facing uncertainty, refer back to these core principles for guidance.
