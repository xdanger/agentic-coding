# Agentic Coding Framework Implementation Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive implementation plan for establishing an effective Agentic Coding Framework, built upon the principles outlined in the project README and supplemented with industry best practices.

## Executive Summary

The Agentic Coding Framework aims to address the limitations of LLMs in software development by creating a structured environment that enhances AI agents' capabilities in global understanding, human intent comprehension, repository history awareness, future work optimization, and integration with manual changes. This plan provides a detailed roadmap for implementing such a framework.

## 1. Core Framework Structure Enhancement

### 1.1 Directory Structure Formalization

Expand upon the existing `.agent` directory structure with the following improvements:

```txt

└── README.md                       # Project overview for users
```

### 1.2 Agent Configuration Files

Create standardized configuration files for different AI agent tools:

1. `CLAUDE.md` - System instructions for Claude Code
2. `.cursor/rules/` - Rules and guidelines for Cursor
3. `.claude/commands/` - Project-wide commands for Claude Code

## 2. Knowledge and Context Management

### 2.1 Global Context Documentation

Develop robust documentation to provide AI agents with comprehensive project understanding:

1. Create `docs/specs/architecture.md` with:
   - Project vision and purpose
   - System architecture overview
   - Key design principles and constraints
   - Critical business rules and requirements

2. Document component details in `docs/specs/`:
   - Purpose and responsibilities of each component
   - Interfaces and dependencies
   - Implementation details
   - Usage examples

### 2.2 History and Memory Management

Implement mechanisms for maintaining long-term history and context:

1. Implement task recording and management in `.agent/tasks/`:
   - Before creating a new task record, check for similar existing tasks
   - Update existing task records instead of creating duplicates
   - Only create new records for distinct tasks
   - Use timestamped filenames (`.agent/tasks/YYYY-MM/DD_{TIMESTAMP}.md`) for distributed development
   - Maintain update history within task records
   - Capture comprehensive task information:
     - Task description and goals
     - Implementation approaches considered
     - Decisions made and rationales
     - Changes implemented
     - Issues encountered and resolutions

2. Support for human-maintained documentation in `docs/`:
   - Humans are responsible for creating and updating all documentation in the `docs/` directory
   - Agents MUST NOT create or modify any files in the `docs/` directory without explicit human instruction
   - Agents may assist humans by suggesting changes to documentation, but must wait for human approval
   - Agents may reference and learn from existing documentation in this directory
   - Agents should recommend when formal decision records are needed in `docs/decisions/`, but MUST NEVER create or modify these records under any circumstances

3. Establish periodic reflection and knowledge consolidation:
   - Weekly summaries of tasks and learnings
   - Monthly updates to technical debt and metrics
   - Quarterly architecture reviews

## 3. Standards and Guidelines

### 3.1 Coding Standards

Develop comprehensive coding standards in `docs/specs/coding-standards.md`:

1. Language-specific conventions (syntax, formatting, naming)
2. Architecture patterns and design principles
3. Error handling and logging approaches
4. Performance considerations
5. Security guidelines

### 3.2 Documentation Standards

Create documentation standards in `docs/specs/documentation-standards.md`:

1. Comment formats and requirements
2. API documentation templates
3. Diagram conventions
4. Markdown formatting guidelines
5. Required documentation sections for different artifacts

### 3.3 Testing Standards

Establish testing standards in `docs/specs/testing-standards.md`:

1. Test coverage requirements
2. Testing methodologies (unit, integration, e2e)
3. Test naming conventions
4. Mocking and stubbing approaches
5. Performance testing guidelines

## 4. Technical Debt Management

### 4.1 Debt Identification and Documentation

Create a system for tracking and managing technical debt:

1. Technical debt documentation guidelines:
   - Agents identify technical debt during development
   - Agents MUST NEVER create or modify files in the `docs/` directory without explicit human instruction
   - Agents provide recommendations with:
     - Problem description
     - Impact assessment
     - Proposed solutions
     - Suggested priority and timeline
   - Humans make final decisions on documenting technical debt and maintaining all documentation in the `docs/` directory

2. Regular debt review process:
   - Weekly debt identification during development
   - Monthly debt prioritization meetings
   - Quarterly debt reduction initiatives

### 4.2 Metrics and Performance Tracking

Establish metrics for monitoring project health:

1. Performance metrics in `docs/metrics/performance-metrics.md`:
   - Response time benchmarks
   - Resource utilization stats
   - Throughput measurements

2. Code quality metrics in `docs/metrics/code-quality-metrics.md`:
   - Complexity scores
   - Duplication percentage
   - Static analysis results

3. Test coverage metrics in `docs/metrics/test-coverage.md`:
   - Line coverage percentages
   - Branch coverage statistics
   - Critical path testing status

## 5. Agent Workflows and Processes

### 5.1 Task Execution Framework

Develop standardized workflows for agent task execution:

1. Pre-task context gathering:
   - Review `docs/specs/` and `README.md`
   - Check `docs/decisions/` for recent decisions
   - Review related reflection documents in `.agent/reflections/`
   - Assess relevant technical debt in `docs/debts/`
   - Search for similar, existing tasks in `.agent/tasks/` directory
   - Note: Agents should only USE documentation in the `docs/` directory for reference and learning, but never modify these files without explicit human instruction

2. Task documentation management:
   - If similar tasks exist, update the existing task record with new information
   - Only create new task records for distinct, unrelated tasks
   - Use timestamp-based filenames (`.agent/tasks/YYYY-MM/DD_{TIMESTAMP}.md`) for distributed development
   - Maintain an update history section within task records

3. Task execution process:
   - Task planning and approach documentation
   - Implementation with continuous documentation
   - Testing according to standards
   - Documentation updates

4. Post-task reflection:
   - Update reflection documents in `.agent/reflections/`
   - Update existing task records or create new ones in `.agent/tasks/`
   - Identify technical debt and prepare recommendations, but NEVER modify `docs/debts/` without explicit human approval
   - Suggest updates to metrics in `docs/metrics/`, but wait for human approval before making changes to any files in the `docs/` directory

### 5.2 Multi-Agent Collaboration Model

Establish patterns for multiple agents to work collaboratively:

1. Role-based agent specialization:
   - Architecture agents for design decisions
   - Implementation agents for coding
   - Documentation agents for maintaining docs
   - Test agents for verification

2. Handoff protocols between agents:
   - Standardized task transition documentation
   - Work continuity guidelines
   - Context sharing mechanisms

## 6. Implementation Timeline

## 7. Success Metrics

3. Regular updates to standards and templates based on learnings
4. Feedback collection from human developers and AI agents

## 9. Conclusion

The Agentic Coding Framework represents a systematic approach to addressing the limitations of AI/Agent-based software development. By providing comprehensive context, enforcing standards, maintaining history, and optimizing for future work, this framework enables AI agents to function more effectively as part of the software engineering process. Implementation of this plan will result in higher quality code, better documentation, and more efficient use of both human and AI resources.
