# Agentic Coding Framework Implementation Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive implementation plan for establishing an effective Agentic Coding Framework, built upon the principles outlined in the project README and supplemented with industry best practices.

## Executive Summary

The Agentic Coding Framework aims to address the limitations of LLMs in software development by creating a structured environment that enhances AI agents' capabilities in global understanding, human intent comprehension, repository history awareness, future work optimization, and integration with manual changes. This plan provides a detailed roadmap for implementing such a framework.
