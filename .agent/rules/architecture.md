# Architecture Standards

This document defines the architectural standards for the Agentic Coding Framework. It establishes the core system structure, design principles, and directory organization patterns that must be followed to maintain consistency and quality across the project.

## Core Architecture Principles

### Service-Oriented Design

- Design the system as a collection of loosely coupled services
- Implement clear service boundaries with well-defined interfaces
- Maintain separation of concerns between services
- Define explicit contracts for service interactions
- Document dependencies between services

### Modular Implementation

- Organize code into cohesive modules with single responsibilities
- Keep module interfaces small and focused
- Implement proper encapsulation of implementation details
- Follow the Interface Segregation Principle
- Document module dependencies and interaction patterns

### Scalable Infrastructure

- Design for horizontal scalability when appropriate
- Implement proper resource management
- Consider performance and load characteristics
- Document scaling strategies and limitations
- Implement appropriate caching mechanisms

### Security by Design

- Apply security principles from the architectural level
- Implement defense in depth
- Apply principle of least privilege
- Document security decisions and assumptions
- Include security considerations in component design

## Repository Structure

### Directory Organization

The repository follows a standardized structure to ensure consistency and maintainability:

```

```

### Special Directories

- `.agent/`: For AI agent configuration, task tracking, and agent-specific documentation
- `docs/`: For all project documentation, separated by purpose
- `src/`: For source code, organized by logical layers

## Component Architecture

### Component Structure

- Implement a consistent component structure with clear separation of:
  - Presentation logic
  - Business logic
  - Data access logic
- Define clear interfaces between these layers
- Maintain unidirectional data flow when possible
- Document component responsibilities and interactions

### State Management

- Establish a consistent state management pattern
- Centralize shared state appropriately
- Minimize state duplication
- Document state transitions and side effects
- Implement proper state isolation between components

### Error Handling

- Design consistent error handling patterns
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Document error recovery strategies
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

## Infrastructure Architecture

### Deployment Model

- Design for consistent deployment across environments
- Document environment requirements and dependencies
- Implement proper configuration management
- Consider containerization strategy
- Document scaling considerations

### Networking

- Define secure network architecture
- Document traffic patterns and requirements
- Implement appropriate load balancing
- Consider latency and performance requirements
- Document networking dependencies

### Data Storage

- Define data persistence strategy
- Document data models and relationships
- Implement appropriate data access patterns
- Consider data growth and retention strategies
- Document backup and recovery approaches

## Architecture Documentation

### Documentation Requirements

- Maintain up-to-date architecture diagrams
- Document key architectural decisions with rationales
- Update documentation when architecture evolves
- Include context and constraints in documentation
- Reference industry standards and patterns where appropriate

### Architecture Decision Records

- Document significant architectural decisions in `/docs/decisions/`
- Include context, options considered, decision outcome, and consequences
- Number decision records sequentially
- Reference decision records from implementation documentation
- Update decision records when decisions are revisited

## Architecture Evolution

### Change Process

- Evaluate architectural changes against established principles
- Document rationale for architectural changes
- Consider backward compatibility
- Plan migration paths for breaking changes
- Communicate architectural changes to stakeholders

### Technical Debt Management

- Document architectural technical debt
- Prioritize debt resolution based on impact
- Plan for incremental architecture improvements
- Document workarounds and their implications
- Maintain a roadmap for architecture evolution
