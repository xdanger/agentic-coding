# Code and Development Standards

This document defines the mandatory standards for code quality and development practices in this project. Consistent adherence to these standards ensures maintainable, efficient, and high-quality code.

## Code Quality

### Readability and Maintainability

- Write self-documenting code with clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Limit function complexity (cyclomatic complexity < 10)
- Use meaningful comments to explain "why" not "what"
- Follow consistent indentation and formatting
- Maintain a clean, logical structure within files

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Abstract common patterns into reusable components
- Create utilities for operations used in multiple places
- Use inheritance or composition to reduce duplication
- Leverage existing libraries rather than reimplementing functionality
- Document shared components for reusability

### Performance Optimization

- Use efficient data structures appropriate for the task
- Minimize unnecessary computations, especially in loops
- Implement caching for expensive operations
- Optimize render cycles in UI components
- Load resources lazily when beneficial
- Consider algorithmic complexity (Big O notation)

### Error Handling

- Handle all potential errors and edge cases
- Use try/catch blocks appropriately
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with relevant context information
- Fail gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Design for resilience and recovery

## Development Practices

### Version Control

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- Create small, focused commits that address a single concern
- Branch from main/develop for features using a clear naming convention
- Rebase before merging to maintain a clean history
- Never commit sensitive data or credentials

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Include integration tests for critical paths
- Write tests that verify requirements, not implementation details
- Keep tests independent and isolated
- Update tests when requirements change

### Code Review

- Review all code changes before merging
- Check for adherence to coding standards
- Look for security vulnerabilities
- Verify test coverage
- Provide constructive feedback
- Consider performance implications

### Continuous Integration

- Ensure all tests pass before merging
- Run static code analysis as part of CI
- Verify build processes in CI environment
- Address CI failures promptly
- Automate deployment processes

## Technical Standards

### Security

- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies updated to prevent vulnerabilities

### Accessibility

- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Provide alternative text for images
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Maintain sufficient color contrast
- Test with screen readers

### Dependency Management

- Evaluate dependencies carefully before adding them
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Minimize the number of dependencies
- Document reasons for choosing specific libraries
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- Consider dependency size and performance impact

### Documentation

- Document complex algorithms and business logic
- Update documentation when code changes
- Document public APIs comprehensively
- Include usage examples for components
- Document known limitations and edge cases

## Language-Specific Standards

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use strong typing with TypeScript
- Follow ESLint rules without exceptions
- Prefer functional programming patterns when appropriate
- Use async/await instead of raw promises
- Avoid global variables
- Use modern ES6+ features

### CSS/Styling

- Use CSS modules or styled components to prevent style leaks
- Follow BEM naming convention when using class selectors
- Maintain a consistent color system
- Create reusable style components
- Keep specificity low
- Use responsive design principles

### Language-Agnostic Patterns

- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Implement dependency injection where appropriate
- Use design patterns appropriately for the problem domain
- Follow SOLID principles
- Use immutable data patterns when possible
