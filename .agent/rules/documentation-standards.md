# Documentation Standards

This document outlines the required standards for all documentation in this project. Consistent, high-quality documentation is essential for maintaining project knowledge and enabling efficient collaboration.

## Documentation Formats

### Markdown Files

- Use `.md` extension for standard documentation
- Follow a consistent header structure (H1 for title, H2 for major sections, H3+ for subsections)
- Include a table of contents for documents longer than 500 lines
- Use syntax highlighting for code blocks (e.g., ```javascript)
- Include line numbers in examples when referencing specific parts of code

### JSDoc/TSDoc Comments

- Document all public functions, classes, and interfaces
- Include parameter descriptions, return types, and examples
- Document thrown exceptions and side effects
- Link to related documentation when appropriate
- Use consistent tags (@param, @returns, etc.)

### README Files

- Each directory should contain a README.md file explaining its purpose
- Root README should include:
  - Project overview
  - Installation instructions
  - Basic usage examples
  - Links to more detailed documentation
  - Contribution guidelines

### Diagrams

- Store diagrams in the `/docs/diagrams` directory
- Include source files for diagrams (e.g., .drawio files)
- Export diagrams to PNG or SVG format for inclusion in documentation
- Provide a text description below each diagram for accessibility

## Content Organization

### File Structure

- Group related documentation files in appropriate directories
- Use clear, descriptive filenames following kebab-case
- Maintain a logical hierarchy that mirrors the project structure
- Create an index or navigation file for documentation collections

### Documentation Style

- Write in clear, concise language
- Target appropriate technical level for the intended audience
- Use active voice and present tense
- Include examples for complex concepts
- Define acronyms and technical terms on first use
- Avoid subjective language and opinions

### Content Requirements

- Maintain a CHANGELOG.md following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format
- Document all APIs with examples and use cases
- Include troubleshooting sections for common issues
- Provide context and rationale for significant design decisions
- Reference related external resources when applicable

## Maintenance Process

### Review Guidelines

- Documentation changes require review just like code changes
- Check for technical accuracy, completeness, and clarity
- Ensure consistent formatting and style
- Verify that links work and references are accurate
- Test any included code examples

### Update Process

- Update documentation whenever related code changes
- Mark outdated sections clearly if immediate updates aren't possible
- Review all documentation quarterly for accuracy
- Version documentation to match software releases when appropriate
- Archive deprecated documentation rather than deleting it

## Documentation Tools

- Use automated documentation generators for API documentation
- Set up linting for documentation files to ensure consistency
- Implement documentation testing for code examples
- Consider using static site generators for published documentation
