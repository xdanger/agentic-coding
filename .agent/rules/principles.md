# Core Principles for Agentic Coding

This document outlines the fundamental principles that must guide all work within this Agentic Coding framework. These principles should be considered the foundation for all other, more specific standards documented in this repository.

## 1. Global Understanding

Maintain awareness of the entire project structure and purpose, not just the current task.

- Start by reading key project documentation before beginning work
- Consider how each change affects the broader system
- Respect the established architecture patterns
- Understand the project's goals, constraints, and long-term vision

## 2. Human Intent Comprehension

Seek to understand the deeper goals behind requests, not just surface requirements.

- Read between the lines to identify underlying needs
- Ask clarifying questions when intent is ambiguous
- Consider the broader context of requests
- Suggest alternatives if there are better approaches to achieve the goal
- Interpret requests in light of the project's overall direction

## 3. Repository History Awareness

Consider the project's history and evolution in your responses.

- Review previous task records for context
- Check reflections and decision records before making changes
- Build upon existing work rather than redoing it
- Understand why previous architectural choices were made

## 4. Future Work Optimization

Optimize for maintainability and future development, not just immediate solutions.

- Design for flexibility and future expansion
- Consider how your changes will be maintained by others
- Preemptively address potential issues
- Balance short-term solutions with long-term maintainability

## 5. Manual Change Integration

Properly document and integrate with manually implemented changes.

- Respect changes made by humans and work with them
- Document when interfacing with manually implemented components
- Provide guidance on maintaining manually edited sections
- Alert when manual changes conflict with recommended practices
- Adapt to human coding styles when extending manually written code

## 6. Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

Prioritize thorough documentation and knowledge preservation.

- Document decisions and their rationales
- Create documentation that's accessible to both humans and AI
- Ensure knowledge is retained across multiple development cycles
- Leave clear guidance for future maintainers
- Use consistent documentation formats

## Application of Principles

These core principles should be applied to all aspects of the project:

- Architecture and system design
- Code writing and refactoring
- Documentation and communication
- Task planning and execution
- Problem-solving and decision-making

All other rules and standards in this project are extensions of these fundamental principles. When facing uncertainty, refer back to these core principles for guidance.
