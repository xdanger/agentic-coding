# Interfaces

This document defines standards for interfaces in the Agentic Coding Framework, including APIs, component interactions, and contract design principles. Consistent interfaces promote modularity, maintainability, and proper system integration.

## API Design Principles

### RESTful API Standards

- Follow RESTful principles for HTTP-based APIs
- Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- Return appropriate status codes with descriptive messages
- Implement proper resource naming conventions
  - Use plural nouns for resource collections
  - Use hierarchical relationships with nested paths
- Version APIs using URL path prefix (e.g., `/api/v1/resource`)
- Implement consistent pagination, filtering, and sorting mechanisms
- Use JSON for request/response bodies
- Document APIs using OpenAPI/Swagger

### GraphQL API Standards

- Create a well-defined schema with appropriate types
- Follow naming conventions consistently
- Implement proper authorization at the resolver level
- Use pagination for collection queries
- Consider query complexity and depth limitations
- Provide meaningful error responses
- Optimize resolvers to prevent N+1 query problems
- Document schema with descriptive comments

### API Security

- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS for all API communication
- Apply rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Implement input validation on all parameters
- Avoid exposing sensitive information in responses
- Use appropriate token-based authentication (JWT, OAuth)
- Define clear permission models
- Log security-relevant events

## Component Interface Design

### Component Contracts

- Define clear input/output contracts for each component
- Document required and optional parameters
- Specify expected behavior and error conditions
- Maintain backward compatibility when evolving interfaces
- Use strong typing for interface definitions
- Minimize dependencies between components
- Create interface-first designs before implementation

### State Management

- Define clear ownership of shared state
- Document state transitions and side effects
- Use immutable patterns for state updates
- Implement predictable state management patterns
- Provide mechanisms for state observation
- Document initial state values and default behaviors

### Event Systems

- Document event names, payloads, and purposes
- Establish consistent event naming conventions
- Define clear producer/consumer relationships
- Implement appropriate error handling in event consumers
- Consider event ordering and synchronization needs
- Document delivery guarantees (at-least-once, exactly-once)

## Frontend Interface Standards

### Component APIs

- Create self-contained UI components with clear props interfaces
- Document required and optional props
- Define callback patterns consistently
- Implement proper prop validation
- Maintain single responsibility for components
- Document component lifecycle behavior
- Consider accessibility in component design

### UI/UX Consistency

- Establish and follow a design system
- Implement consistent interaction patterns
- Define and follow a shared design language
- Document responsive behavior expectations
- Ensure consistent error state handling and user feedback
- Define clear loading state indicators

## Data Interface Standards

### Database Interfaces

- Abstract database access behind well-defined interfaces
- Document entity relationships and constraints
- Define clear transaction boundaries
- Implement consistent error handling
- Create appropriate indexes for query patterns
- Document expected performance characteristics
- Include data validation rules

### File Format Specifications

- Document file formats with examples
- Define validation requirements for file inputs
- Specify character encoding standards
- Document versioning mechanisms for evolving formats
- Implement graceful handling of legacy formats
- Consider internationalization requirements

## Interface Documentation

### Documentation Requirements

- Document all public interfaces comprehensively
- Include examples of proper usage
- Document error cases and handling
- Maintain documentation alongside code
- Update documentation when interfaces change
- Document breaking changes and migration paths
- Provide changelogs for interface evolution

### Interface Testing

- Create automated tests for interface contracts
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Implement integration tests across component boundaries
- Document test coverage requirements
- Validate backwards compatibility in tests
- Create example implementations for complex interfaces

## Interface Evolution

### Versioning Strategy

- Follow semantic versioning for APIs
- Document deprecation policies
- Maintain backward compatibility within major versions
- Provide migration guides for breaking changes
- Support multiple versions during transition periods
- Clearly mark experimental interfaces

### Monitoring and Metrics

- Track interface usage and performance metrics
- Monitor error rates and patterns
- Implement health checks for service interfaces
- Document expected performance characteristics
- Define SLAs for critical interfaces
- Create dashboards for interface health monitoring
